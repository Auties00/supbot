		command must be of format: action ActionClassName param1 param2 paramN
		to add an action to ActionCallerCC, the class of the target Action should be added into RemoteActionCall
		
	Created CheckerCallerCC (Console Command)

    Fixed Bug(s):
        processes old chat  when visiting new groups without CheckInNewGroupAction
            cause: gotoGroup() method in ActionManager doesn't reset the chat of the group
            fix: removed ActionTaskFunctions.resetAndPutChatInGroupChat() call from CheckInNewGroupAction and added it
                 into gotoGroup() method in ActionManager

18/4/18:
    Created Bubble
        abstraction of selenium webelement of whatsapp chat

    Created ChatProcessor and ChatProcessorManager
        ChatProcessor processes the bubble of chat sent by a client and perform appropriate actions
        ChatProcessorManager manages a list of ChatProcessors and executes them when process() method is called
        To add ChatProcessor in ChatProcessorManager, Bot.getChatProcessorManager.add() can be used
        ChatProcessor can be ran in multithread for optimization. (configured in ChatProcessor constructor)

    Created CommandCP
        Code from ActionTaskFunction.processBubbleThenProcessCommand is moved to CommandCP as ChatProcessor Abstraction

    Deprecated BubbleFunctions
        Use Bubble class instead of BubbleFunctions

16/4/18:
    Created Database and DatabaseManager
        to control the version of the tables in mysqlite

    Created Configuration
        save and retrieve name value pair which is saved on disk

    Fixed Bug(s):
        exception in ClientDatabase.getClient when client is not found in database
            cause: trying to use result set even though its not pointing to anything
            solution: return null client when result set is'nt point before first, before using the result set

        CheckInNewGroupAction is called even though message comes in current group
            cause: xpath was set to detect just the new message sign (the (1) sign) in the chat list
            solution: updated newChatGroup XPath

    Optimization(s):
        In ActionTaskFunctions Class in resetAndPutChatInGroupChat function:
            instead of queering database to get correct client, just use a temp client.

    Initialization in Looper
        Initialization of different components of bot is done after the init() method in looper
        to add more initialization, ExtraLooperFunctions.moreInits can be used in while creating Looper object in main


7/4/18:
    Log even if debug is off
        Log error
        Log reply

    Added Run Console Command
        way to run bot command from console
        run <gid> <cmd> <args>

    Fixed Bug(s):
        exception in ClientDatabase.getClient when name is null
            cause: BubbleFunction.getAuthorNameFromBubble returns null for the bubble who doesn't have author in top
            solution: when Client.getClient is called with name = null, return a temp client instead of searching in database

    added comments to core actions


6/4/18:
