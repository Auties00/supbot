16/4/18:
    Created Database and DatabaseManager
        to control the version of the tables in mysqlite

    Created Configuration
        save and retrieve name value pair which is saved on disk

    Fixed Bug(s):
        exception in ClientDatabase.getClient when client is not found in database
            cause: trying to use result set even though its not pointing to anything
            solution: return null client when result set is'nt point before first, before using the result set

        CheckInNewGroupAction is called even though message comes in current group
            cause: xpath was set to detect just the new message sign (the (1) sign) in the chat list
            solution: updated newChatGroup XPath

    Optimization(s):
        In ActionTaskFunctions Class in resetAndPutChatInGroupChat function:
            instead of queering database to get correct client, just use a temp client.

        Log reply

    Added Run Console Command
        way to run bot command from console

    Fixed Bug(s):
        exception in ClientDatabase.getClient when name is null
            cause: BubbleFunction.getAuthorNameFromBubble returns null for the bubble who doesn't have author in top
            solution: when Client.getClient is called with name = null, return a temp client instead of searching in database

    added comments to core actions
