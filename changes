7/4/18:
    Log even if debug is off
        Log error
        Log reply

    Added Run Console Command
        way to run bot command from console
        run <gid> <cmd> <args>

    Fixed Errors:
        exception in DatabaseManager.getClient when name is null
        cause: BubbleFunction.getAuthorNameFromBubble returns null for the bubble who doesn't have author in top
        solution: when Client.getClient is called with name = null, return a temp client instead of searching in database

    added comments to core actions
